# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System**! This app uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to recommend movies based on your preferences, such as favorite actors and genres.

## How It Works

This project uses **Streamlit** to create a simple web interface where you can:
- Enter your name.
- Choose your favorite actors and genres.
- Get personalized movie recommendations!

The AI behind the scenes analyzes your choices and recommends movies tailored to your taste.

## Features

- **User-friendly interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Personalized recommendations**: Provides suggestions based on actors and genres you like.
- **Data storage**: Saves your feedback and responses for future use in improving recommendations.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application
After installing the dependencies, run the Streamlit app:
