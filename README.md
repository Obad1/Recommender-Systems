Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System**! 

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to recommend movies based on your preferences. Whether you're a fan of action-packed thrillers, heartwarming dramas, or captivating sci-fi adventures, this system provides personalized movie suggestions tailored to your tastes.

#### Key Features:
1. **User-Centered Experience**: Users can provide feedback on their favorite genres, actors, and directors.
2. **AI-Powered Recommendations**: The system analyzes the provided inputs and generates personalized movie suggestions using advanced machine learning techniques.
3. **Streamlit Web Interface**: This project provides a sleek and intuitive interface built with **Streamlit**, allowing easy interaction between the user and the recommendation engine.
4. **Dynamic Feedback Loop**: Users can rate the recommendations, providing valuable feedback to continuously improve the system.

#### How It Works:
The core of the system is a **neural network-based recommender model** that processes the user's preferences (actors, genres, etc.) and predicts the most likely movies they might enjoy. The training data consists of historical ratings, movie metadata (genre, director, etc.), and user feedback, enabling the system to refine recommendations over time.

The project includes multiple datasets that combine **movie metadata**, **ratings data**, and **user input** to create a robust system. Key components include data merging, cleaning, normalization, and feature encoding, all of which feed into the neural network model.

#### Quick Start Guide:
1. **Clone the repository** and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Run the application** with `streamlit run app.py` to launch the web interface.
3. **Get personalized movie recommendations** by filling out a questionnaire with your favorite genres, actors, and directors.
4. **Rate the movie suggestions**, which will be saved and used to improve future recommendations.

#### Contributing:
Feel free to fork and enhance the project! Whether it's adding new features, improving the recommendation algorithm, or enhancing the user interface, your contributions are welcome!
